‎Slater Metz‎ to Cubers United
8 hrs · Whitewater, WI · 
Hey guys...long time no talk. AAAANyways i decided to take a cube with me when i went to a conference so i had 28 hours of cubing (didnt cube the whole time but still) taught 2 people how to cube overall a good time. So i was just curious what cubes everyone is using now a days. Not even sure where i stopped. I have the zanchi and the zanchi 50mm and 42 mm but idk which others i have. might buy a new cube might not but i wanted to know whats good. And if you want to know yes i forgot a lot of algorithms but someone i can do them in a solve but not after the solve its weird.
